/// ```
/// #define TPM2B_TYPE(name, bytes)  \
///     typedef union {              \
///     struct  {                    \
///         UINT16  size;            \
///         BYTE    buffer[(bytes)]; \
///     } t;                         \
///     TPM2B   b;                   \
///     } TPM2B_##name

/// #define TPM2B_TYPE1(name, bytes, bufferName) \

///     } t;                                     \
///     TPM2B   b;                               \
///     } TPM2B_##name
///
/// #define TPM2B_TYPE2(name, type, bufferName ) \
///     typedef union {                          \
///     struct  {                                \
///         UINT16  size;                        \

 * This structure is designed as a scalable-sized buffer.
 *
 * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException: Size indicator should NEVER be set larger
 * than the longest digest length produced by each implemented hash algorithm.
 * The max buffer size may be  64, 48, 32 or even only 20 bytes, which depends
 * on the actual size of TPMU_HA inside the libsapi's binary distribution.
